    @title: Verifying Fair Wages for Coffee Laborers in El Salvador
    @author: Lehigh University Chainbytes capstone project team
*/

/**
    OUR GOAL: to make sure that coffee laborers in El Salvador are being paid a fair
    wage using blockchain technology.  We're using a blockchain because blockchains are 
    irrefutable.  When a transaciton is on chain, nobody can refute the transaction.  
    So what functionality do we need to be irrefutable (on chain) to accomplish our goal?  
    The payment of workers is one function that needs to be irrefutable.  Also, we need 
    a function to indicate that a worker did indeed work each day so the public can 
    compare the amount of days they worked to the amount they were paid.  Foremen handle 
    checking in workers each day and farms handle the paying of wages to workers.  This is the
    core functionality of our minimum viable product.  We wrote this contract to accomplish
    just our MVP.
    
    'farms' and 'foremen' in this contract are treated like a role for access control purposes.
    Only addresses that are farms should be allowed to pay workers and assign addresses to foremen roles.
    Only addresses that are foremen should be allowed to check in workers.

    This contract handles farms, foremen, and workers all as individual addresses
    and not large structs with multiple parameters.

    /**
        For paying workers and checking in we will leverage theGraph.

        We want to be able to keep track of which days the worker checked in, and 
        which days they're paid for.  This is difficult and expensive to do on chain.  
        We can solve this by handling payment history and worker/foreman/farm
        association in a subgraph, which is okay to do because our goal in this project is 
        simply irrefutably showing that the worker got paid.  If somone wants to check which 
        days a worker checked in, on the front end we can return a list of all emitted 
        workerCheckedIn and workerPaid events for that address by querying our subgraph.

        For associating workers to foremen, this can also be handled in our subgraph because
        we have no need to get a list of all workers for a foreman in this contract.  When the
        event workerCheckedIn(address foreman, address worker, string date) is called, the subgraph
        can add the worker to an array of addresses for a worker.  If someone wanted to verify this,
        they could simple query our subgraph for all workers associated with a foreman.
